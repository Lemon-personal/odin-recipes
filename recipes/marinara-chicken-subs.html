        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine chicken, marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, garlic, salt, 
                and pepper in a crockpot. Cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours or on 
                High for 2 to 3 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off crockpot and transfer chicken to a cutting board. 
                Shred chicken into bite sized pieces using two forks or a 
                hand mixer and return to the crockpot. Stir in Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Brush the inside of each sub roll with 
                butter and toast in the preheated oven until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
               Cover the inside of each toasted bun with shredded mozzarella 
               cheese, spoon chicken mixture into the bun and top with a slice of provolone cheese. 
               Set buns on a baking sheet and return to the oven for 3 to 4 minutes until cheese is melted. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish sandwiches with chopped fresh parsley and freshly grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
