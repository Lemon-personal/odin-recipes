           Garlic noodles are simple yet delicious dish that, according
           to sources, was invented back in the '70s in a restraunt

                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Stir soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl for the secret sauce.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Quickly stir in the secret sauce and turn off the heat.</li>
